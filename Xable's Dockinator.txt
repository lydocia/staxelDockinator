[b]Description[/b]

A simple mod that adds 1 new workbench called the Dockinator, that adds or removes docks from a furniture item.
Simply put the item on the workbench, give it a few seconds, et voil√†: you now have its (un)docked counterpart!

Currently, only the vanilla items that already had an existing No Dock counterpart are supported:
- Contemporary Desk
- Contemporary Side Table
- Kitchen Counter
- Minimalist Large Table
- Office Counter
- Office Desk
- Ranch Coffee Table
- Ranch Double Bed
- Ranch Single Bed
- Shop Counter
- Victorian Side Table

Custom docks for other existing furniture will be added later.
